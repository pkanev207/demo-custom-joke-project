## Custom Joke Project

This project is for my course ReactJS at SoftUni and it is with educational purposes only.
The backend is from Firebase and the styling is with styled-components.

### How to use

For not register user there are several accessible pages: Home, About, Login, Register and the Dashboard for quick jokes. In addition, the registered user can access the database to store or create own jokes, delete or edit existing ones.
